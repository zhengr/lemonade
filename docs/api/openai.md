## `POST /v1/chat/completions`
<sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-partially_available-green)</sub>

Chat Completions API. You provide a list of messages and receive a completion. This API will also load the model if it is not already loaded.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description | Status |
|-----------|----------|-------------|--------|
| `messages` | Yes | Array of messages in the conversation. Each message should have a `role` ("user" or "assistant") and `content` (the message text). | <sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/available-green)</sub> |
| `model` | Yes | The model to use for the completion. | <sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/available-green)</sub> |

| `max_completion_tokens` | No | An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a completion. Mutually exclusive with `max_tokens`. | <sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/available-green)</sub> |

### Example request

=== "PowerShell"

    ```powershell
    Invoke-WebRequest `
      -Uri "http://localhost:13305/v1/chat/completions" `
      -Method POST `
      -Headers @{ "Content-Type" = "application/json" } `
      -Body '{
        "model": "Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF",
        "messages": [
          {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What is the population of Paris?"
          }
        ],
        "stream": false
      }'
    ```
=== "Bash"

    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:13305/v1/chat/completions \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
            "model": "Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF",
            "messages": [
              {"role": "user", "content": "What is the population of Paris?"}
            ],
            "stream": false
          }'
    ```

### Response format

=== "Non-streaming responses"

    ```json
    {
      "id": "0",
      "object": "chat.completion",
      "created": 1742927481,
      "model": "Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF",
      "choices": [{
        "index": 0,
        "message": {
          "role": "assistant",
          "content": "Paris has a population of approximately 2.2 million people in the city proper."
        },
        "finish_reason": "stop"
      }]
    }
    ```
=== "Streaming responses"
    For streaming responses, the API returns a stream of server-sent events (however, Open AI recommends using their streaming libraries for parsing streaming responses):

    ```json
    {
      "id": "0",
      "object": "chat.completion.chunk",
      "created": 1742927481,
      "model": "Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF",
      "choices": [{
        "index": 0,
        "delta": {
          "role": "assistant",
          "content": "Paris"
        }
      }]
    }
    ```

### Image understanding input format (OpenAI-compatible)

To send images to `chat/completions`, pass a `messages[*].content` array that mixes `text` and `image_url` items. The image can be provided as a base64 data URL (for example, from `FileReader.readAsDataURL(...)` in web apps).

#### Example request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:13305/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "model": "Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct",
        "messages": [
          {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
              {"type": "text", "text": "What is in this image?"},
              {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD..."}}
            ]
          }
        ],
        "stream": false
      }'
```

#### Example response

```json
{
  "id": "0",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1742927481,
  "model": "Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct",
  "choices": [{
    "index": 0,
    "message": {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "The image shows a red apple resting on a wooden table."
    },
    "finish_reason": "stop"
  }]
}
```

### Server-side tools

> **Note:** Omni collection orchestration is a Lemonade-specific extension to the Chat Completions API; it is not part of the OpenAI specification. Requests that target ordinary (non-collection) models are unaffected and are fully OpenAI-compatible.

When `model` names an Omni **collection** model (`recipe: "collection.omni"`, e.g., `LMX-Omni-52B-Halo`), this endpoint runs an internal tool-calling loop instead of a plain completion. The server injects the reference system prompt and tools, routes to the collection's chat component, executes the omni tools (image generation/editing, text-to-speech) against the matching components, and returns one OpenAI-compatible response. Generated media is embedded in the assistant `content`:

- **images** → markdown `![generated image](data:image/png;base64,…)`
- **speech** → `<audio>data:audio/mpeg;base64,…</audio>`

Both non-streaming and `stream: true` are supported. In streaming mode the media arrives as a content delta on a `chat.completion.chunk` frame the moment its tool finishes.

**Merge semantics.** A client-provided system prompt is prepended by the built-in omni system prompt. Client-provided `tools` are merged with the built-in omni tools. The server resolves omni tool calls internally; calls to client-provided tools are returned in a `finish_reason: "tool_calls"` response for the client to execute and resume. Targeting a collection name invokes the server-side loop; targeting a component LLM name bypasses it and returns a plain completion. See [Lemonade Omni Models](../dev/lemonade-omni.md) for details.

#### Example request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:13305/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "model": "LMX-Omni-52B-Halo",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Draw a red apple on a table."}],
        "stream": false
      }'
```

#### Example response

The image tool runs during the loop and its output is embedded as a markdown image in the assistant `content`:

```json
{
  "id": "0",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1742927481,
  "model": "LMX-Omni-52B-Halo",
  "choices": [{
    "index": 0,
    "message": {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Here is a red apple on a table.\n\n![generated image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA...)"
    },
    "finish_reason": "stop"
  }]
}
```

### Streaming Events

The Responses API uses semantic events for streaming. Each event is typed with a predefined schema, so you can listen for events you care about. Our initial implementation only offers support to:

- `response.created`
- `response.output_text.delta`
- `response.completed`

For a full list of event types, see the [API reference for streaming](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses-streaming).

=== "Streaming Responses"
    For streaming responses, the API returns a series of events. Refer to [OpenAI streaming guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/streaming-responses?api-mode=responses) for details.



## `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions`
<sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-partial-yellow)</sub>

Audio Transcription API. You provide an audio file and receive a text transcription. This API will also load the model if it is not already loaded.

> **Note:** This endpoint uses [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) as the backend. Whisper models are automatically downloaded when first used.
>
> **Limitations:** Only `wav` audio format and `json` response format are currently supported.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description | Status |
|-----------|----------|-------------|--------|
| `file` | Yes | The audio file to transcribe. Supported formats: wav. | <sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/partial-yellow)</sub> |
| `model` | Yes | The Whisper model to use for transcription (e.g., `Whisper-Tiny`, `Whisper-Base`, `Whisper-Small`). | <sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/available-green)</sub> |
| `language` | No | The language of the audio (ISO 639-1 code, e.g., `en`, `es`, `fr`). If not specified, Whisper will auto-detect the language. | <sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/available-green)</sub> |
| `response_format` | No | The format of the response. Currently only `json` is supported. | <sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/available-green)</sub> |

### Example request

=== "Windows"

    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:13305/v1/audio/transcriptions ^
      -F "file=@C:\path\to\audio.wav" ^
      -F "model=Whisper-Tiny"
    ```

=== "Linux"

    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:13305/v1/audio/transcriptions \
      -F "file=@/path/to/audio.wav" \
      -F "model=Whisper-Tiny"
    ```

### Response format

```json
{
  "text": "Hello, this is a sample transcription of the audio file."
}
```

**Field Descriptions:**

- `text` - The transcribed text from the audio file



## `WS /realtime`
<sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-partial-yellow)</sub>

Realtime Audio Transcription API via WebSocket (OpenAI SDK compatible). Stream audio from a microphone and receive transcriptions in real-time with Voice Activity Detection (VAD).

> **Limitations:** Only 16kHz mono PCM16 audio format is supported. Uses the same Whisper models as the HTTP transcription endpoint.

### Connection

WebSocket upgrades are accepted **directly on the main HTTP port** (default 13305) — the same port as all REST endpoints. Connect with the model name:

```
ws://localhost:13305/v1/realtime?model=Whisper-Tiny
```

Accepted paths are `/realtime` and `/logs/stream`, bare or under any of the standard prefixes (`/v1`, `/v0`, `/api/v1`, `/api/v0`), so OpenAI Realtime SDK clients (`/v1/realtime`) connect as-is. When `LEMONADE_API_KEY` is set, pass `?api_key=KEY` as a query parameter.

A dedicated WebSocket port also remains for backward compatibility; it is OS-assigned and reported by the [`/v1/health`](./lemonade.md#get-v1health) endpoint (`websocket_port` field). New clients should prefer the main port:

```
ws://localhost:<websocket_port>/realtime?model=Whisper-Tiny
```

Upon connection, the server sends a `session.created` message with a session ID.

### Client → Server Messages

| Message Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `session.update` | Configure the session (set model, VAD settings, or disable turn detection) |
| `input_audio_buffer.append` | Send audio data (base64-encoded PCM16) |
| `input_audio_buffer.commit` | Force transcription of buffered audio |
| `input_audio_buffer.clear` | Clear audio buffer without transcribing |

### Server → Client Messages

| Message Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `session.created` | Session established, contains session ID |
| `session.updated` | Session configuration updated |
| `input_audio_buffer.speech_started` | VAD detected speech start |
| `input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped` | VAD detected speech end, transcription triggered |
| `input_audio_buffer.committed` | Audio buffer committed for transcription |
| `input_audio_buffer.cleared` | Audio buffer cleared |
| `conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.delta` | Interim/partial transcription (replaceable) |
| `conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.completed` | Final transcription result |
| `error` | Error message |

### Example: Configure Session

```json
{
  "type": "session.update",
  "session": {
    "model": "Whisper-Tiny"
  }
}
```

### Example: Send Audio

```json
{
  "type": "input_audio_buffer.append",
  "audio": "<base64-encoded PCM16 audio>"
}
```

Audio should be:
- 16kHz sample rate
- Mono (single channel)
- 16-bit signed integer (PCM16)
- Base64 encoded
- Sent in chunks (~85ms recommended)

### Example: Transcription Result

```json
{
  "type": "conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.completed",
  "transcript": "Hello, this is a test transcription."
}
```

### VAD Configuration

VAD settings can be configured via `session.update`:

```json
{
  "type": "session.update",
  "session": {
    "model": "Whisper-Tiny",
    "turn_detection": {
      "threshold": 0.01,
      "silence_duration_ms": 800,
      "prefix_padding_ms": 250
    }
  }
}
```

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `threshold` | 0.01 | RMS energy threshold for speech detection |
| `silence_duration_ms` | 800 | Silence duration to trigger speech end |
| `prefix_padding_ms` | 250 | Minimum speech duration before triggering |

Set `turn_detection` to `null` to disable server-side VAD and use explicit commits instead:

```json
{
  "type": "session.update",
  "session": {
    "model": "Whisper-Tiny",
    "turn_detection": null
  }
}
```

### Code Examples

A complete, runnable example:

- **[`realtime_transcription.py`](https://github.com/lemonade-sdk/lemonade/blob/main/examples/realtime_transcription.py)** - Python CLI for microphone streaming

```bash
# Stream from microphone
python examples/realtime_transcription.py --model Whisper-Tiny
```

### Integration Notes

- **Audio Format**: Server expects 16kHz mono PCM16. Higher sample rates must be downsampled client-side.
- **Chunk Size**: Send audio in ~85-256ms chunks for optimal latency/efficiency.
- **VAD Behavior**: Server automatically detects speech boundaries and triggers transcription on speech end.
- **Manual Commit**: Set `turn_detection` to `null`, then use `input_audio_buffer.commit` to force transcription. In this mode the server buffers audio but does not emit VAD or interim transcription events.
- **Clear Buffer**: Use `input_audio_buffer.clear` to discard audio without transcribing.
- **Chunking**: We are still tuning the chunking to balance latency vs. accuracy.
- **Migrating off the dedicated port**: Clients that discover `websocket_port` via `/v1/health` and connect there can switch to `ws://HOST:13305/v1/realtime?model=...` — the protocol (events, audio format, auth) is identical on both ports, so it is a URL change only. This also simplifies remote setups (one port to expose) and works through reverse proxies that pass `Upgrade: websocket`. Keep the `websocket_port` fallback only if you must support servers older than this release.


## `POST /v1/images/generations`
<sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-fully_available-green)</sub>

Image Generation API. You provide a text prompt and receive a generated image. This API uses [stable-diffusion.cpp](https://github.com/lemonade-sdk/stable-diffusion.cpp) as the backend.

> **Note:** Image generation uses Stable Diffusion models. Available models include `SD-Turbo` (fast, ~4 steps), `SDXL-Turbo`, `SD-1.5`, and `SDXL-Base-1.0`.
>
> **Performance:** CPU inference takes ~4-5 minutes per image. GPU (Vulkan) is faster but may have compatibility issues with some hardware.

## `POST /v1/images/upscale`
<sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-fully_available-green)</sub>

Image Upscaling API. You provide a base64-encoded image and a Real-ESRGAN model name, and receive a 4x upscaled image. This API uses the `sd-cli` binary from [stable-diffusion.cpp](https://github.com/lemonade-sdk/stable-diffusion.cpp) to perform super-resolution.

> **Note:** Available upscale models are `RealESRGAN-x4plus` (general-purpose, 64 MB) and `RealESRGAN-x4plus-anime` (optimized for anime-style art, 17 MB). Both produce a 4x resolution increase (e.g., 256x256 → 1024x1024).
>
> **Note:** Unlike `/images/edits` and `/images/variations`, this endpoint accepts a JSON body (not multipart/form-data). The image must be provided as a base64-encoded string.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description | Status |
|-----------|----------|-------------|--------|
| `image` | Yes | Base64-encoded PNG image to upscale. | <sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/available-green)</sub> |
| `model` | Yes | The ESRGAN model to use (e.g., `RealESRGAN-x4plus`, `RealESRGAN-x4plus-anime`). | <sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/available-green)</sub> |

### Example request

A typical workflow is to generate an image first, then upscale it:

=== "Bash"

    ```bash
    # Step 1: Generate an image and save the base64 response
    RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:13305/v1/images/generations \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
            "model": "SD-Turbo",
            "prompt": "A serene mountain landscape at sunset",
            "size": "512x512",
            "steps": 4,
            "response_format": "b64_json"
          }')

    # Step 2: Build the upscale JSON payload and pipe it to curl via stdin
    # (base64 images are too large for command-line interpolation)
    echo "$RESPONSE" | python3 -c "
    import sys, json
    b64 = json.load(sys.stdin)['data'][0]['b64_json']
    print(json.dumps({'image': b64, 'model': 'RealESRGAN-x4plus'}))
    " | curl -X POST http://localhost:13305/v1/images/upscale \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d @-
    ```

      -Method POST `
      -Headers @{ "Content-Type" = "application/json" } `
      -Body $body
    ```

=== "Python (requests)"

    ```python
    import requests
    import base64

    BASE_URL = "http://localhost:13305/api/v1"

    # Step 1: Generate an image

    upscale_response = requests.post(f"{BASE_URL}/images/upscale", json={
        "image": image_b64,
        "model": "RealESRGAN-x4plus",
    })

    # Step 3: Save the upscaled image to a file
    upscaled_b64 = upscale_response.json()["data"][0]["b64_json"]
    with open("upscaled.png", "wb") as f:
        f.write(base64.b64decode(upscaled_b64))
    ```

## `POST /v1/audio/speech`
<sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-fully_available-green)</sub>

Speech Generation API. You provide a text input and receive an audio file. This API uses [Kokoros](https://github.com/lucasjinreal/Kokoros) as the backend.

> **Note:** Supported models are `kokoro-v1` (fixed voices, [Kokoros](https://github.com/lucasjinreal/Kokoros) backend) and the OpenMOSS family — `OpenMOSS-TTS` (voice cloning from a reference WAV) and `MOSS-VoiceGen` (voice design from a text description).
>
> **Limitations:** `kokoro-v1` supports `mp3`, `wav`, `opus`, and `pcm`; OpenMOSS models natively produce `wav` only, and other formats are rejected with `400 Bad Request`. Streaming is supported in `audio` (`pcm`) mode on `kokoro-v1`.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description | Status |
|-----------|----------|-------------|--------|
| `input` | Yes | The text to speak. | <sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/available-green)</sub> |

| `speed` | No | Speaking speed. Default: `1.0`. | <sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/available-green)</sub> |
| `voice` | No | The voice to use. All OpenAI-defined voices can be used (`alloy`, `ash`, ...), as well as those defined by the kokoro model (`af_sky`, `am_echo`, ...). Default: `shimmer` | <sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/partial-yellow)</sub> |
| `voice` (OpenMOSS) | No | For OpenMOSS models the field is a free-text voice/style instruction instead of a fixed voice name (e.g. `a calm, deep male narrator voice`). | <sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/available-green)</sub> |
| `reference_wav_b64` | No | Lemonade extension (OpenMOSS voice cloning): base64-encoded WAV sample of the voice to clone. | <sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/available-green)</sub> |
| `response_format` | No | Format of the response. `mp3`, `wav`, `opus`, and `pcm` are supported. Default: `mp3`| <sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/partial-yellow)</sub> |
| `stream_format` | No | If set, the response will be streamed. Only `audio` is supported, which will output `pcm` audio. Default: not set| <sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/partial-yellow)</sub> |

### Example request

=== "Bash"

    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:13305/v1/audio/speech \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
            "model": "kokoro-v1",
            "input": "Lemonade can speak!",
            "speed": 1.0,
            "steps": 4,
            "response_format": "mp3"
          }'
    ```

### Response format

The generated audio file is returned as-is.


## `GET /v1/models`
<sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-fully_available-green)</sub>

Returns a list of models available on the server in an OpenAI-compatible format. Each model object includes extended fields like `checkpoint`, `recipe`, `size`, `downloaded`, `labels`, and, when known, `max_context_window`.

By default, only models available locally (downloaded) are shown, matching OpenAI API behavior.

When `lemond` is configured with cloud providers, cloud-routed models appear here alongside local ones with `recipe: "cloud"` and a `cloud_provider` field. They are dot-namespaced by provider (e.g. `fireworks.kimi-k2p5`) and accept the standard chat-completions / completions requests below — see [Cloud Offload](../guide/configuration/cloud.md).

### Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `show_all` | No | If set to `true`, returns all models from the catalog including those not yet downloaded. Defaults to `false`. |

### Example request

```bash
# Show only downloaded models (OpenAI-compatible)
curl http://localhost:13305/v1/models

# Show all models including not-yet-downloaded (extended usage)
curl http://localhost:13305/v1/models?show_all=true
```

  - `recipe` - Backend/device recipe used to load the model (e.g., `"ryzenai-llm"`, `"llamacpp"`, `"flm"`)
  - `size` - Model size in GB (omitted for models without size information)
  - `max_context_window` - Optional integer indicating the maximum model-supported text context discovered from local static metadata. Currently populated for downloaded GGUF/llama.cpp models and installed FLM text-context models.
  - `downloaded` - Boolean indicating if the model is downloaded and available locally
  - `update_available` - Boolean indicating a newer commit exists on HuggingFace for this model. Only set for downloaded HF-backed models. `false` otherwise.
  - `suggested` - Boolean indicating if the model is recommended for general use
  - `labels` - Array of tags describing the model's capabilities and characteristics. See [Model Labels](#model-labels) for the full list.
  - `image_defaults` - (Image models only) Default generation parameters for the model:
    - `steps` - Number of inference steps (e.g., 4 for turbo models, 20 for standard models)
    - `cfg_scale` - Classifier-free guidance scale (e.g., 1.0 for turbo models, 7.5 for standard models)
    - `width` - Default image width in pixels
    - `height` - Default image height in pixels
  - `components` - (Omni collections only, `recipe: "collection.omni"`) Ordered array of the component model names that make up the collection
  - `models` - (Omni collections only) Ordered array embedding each component's full model object (same shape as the entries in this list), parallel to `components`. This makes a collection's `/v1/models/{model_id}` response self-contained — exporting it produces a file that can be imported elsewhere via [`/v1/pull`](./lemonade.md#post-v1pull)


### Model Labels

Labels describe what a model can do. A model may carry multiple labels.

**Deployment labels** — determine which backend endpoint the model is routed to:

| Label | Endpoint | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `transcription` | `/audio/transcriptions` | Speech-to-text transcription model (e.g. Whisper). Mutually exclusive with LLM deployment. |
| `embeddings` | `/embeddings` | Produces text embedding vectors. |
| `reranking` | `/reranking` | Scores and reranks a list of passages given a query. |
| `image` | `/images/generations` | Text-to-image generation model. |
| `edit` | Image editing model; supports the `/images/edits` endpoint. |
| `tts` | `/audio/speech` | Text-to-speech synthesis model. |

**Input-modality labels** — the model is deployed as an LLM but accepts additional input types in `/chat/completions`:

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `vision` | Accepts image attachments in chat messages. |
| `chat-transcription` | Accepts audio attachments in chat messages (e.g. Qwen2.5-Omni). |

**Streaming labels** — capability flags for real-time features:

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `realtime-transcription` | Supports the WebSocket `/realtime` endpoint for live microphone transcription. |

**Runtime labels** — affect backend launch defaults:

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `mtp` | Enables llama.cpp MTP draft decoding defaults (`--spec-type draft-mtp --spec-draft-n-max 3 --spec-draft-p-min 0.75`); users can override these with `llamacpp_args`. |

**Characteristic labels** — informational, do not affect routing:

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `hot` | Featured or popular model, highlighted in the UI. |
| `reasoning` | Uses extended chain-of-thought reasoning (e.g. DeepSeek, Qwen3). |
| `tool-calling` | Supports function/tool calling in chat completions. |
| `coding` | Tuned for code generation and software tasks. |
| `upscaling` | Image upscaling model (e.g. Real-ESRGAN). Used as a component in image pipelines. |
| `experimental` | Not yet validated for production use. |


## `GET /v1/models/{model_id}`
<sub>![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-fully_available-green)</sub>

Retrieve a specific model by its ID. Returns the same model object format as the list endpoint above.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `model_id` | Yes | The ID of the model to retrieve. Must match one of the model IDs from the [models list](https://lemonade-server.ai/models.html). |

### Example request

```bash
curl http://localhost:13305/v1/models/Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF
```

### Response format

Returns a single model object with the same fields as described in the [models list endpoint](#get-v1models) above. For Omni collections (`recipe: "collection.omni"`), the object additionally carries `components` (ordered component names) and `models` (each component's full model object) — see the [collection file documentation](../guide/configuration/custom-models.md#share-a-collection-export-import-and-hugging-face).

```json
{
  "id": "Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF",
  "created": 1744173590,
  "object": "model",
  "owned_by": "lemonade",
  "checkpoint": "unsloth/Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF:Q4_0",
  "recipe": "llamacpp",
  "size": 0.38,
  "max_context_window": 40960,
  "downloaded": true,
  "suggested": true,
  "labels": ["reasoning"],
  "recipe_options": {
    "ctx_size": 8192,
    "llamacpp_args": "--no-mmap",
    "llamacpp_backend": "rocm"
  }
}
```

### Error responses

If the model is not found, the endpoint returns a 404 error:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Model Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF has not been found",
    "type": "not_found"
  }
}
```
